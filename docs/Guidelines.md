# Vision

Several tools have been developed for asteroseismic analyses, but many of them are closed-source and therefore inaccessible to the general astronomy community. Whereas some efforts have been made to provide publicly available open-source tools for asteroseismic modelling, these predominantly concern the analysis of solar-like oscillators. Foam tries to extend this effort to the modelling of gravity mode oscillators.
