Git clone this repository, and install using poetry (https://python-poetry.org/docs/) with command `poetry install` in the folder with the `pyproject.toml` file. This will install the package with all its dependencies, using the dependency versions as specified in the `poetry.lock` file. (The package will be installed in editable mode, so it will link the package to the original location, meaning any changes to the original package will be reflected directly in your environment.)

If you do not wish to use poetry, you could install by running `pip install .` instead. Note that this will install it as a package in your python environment, but in non-editable mode.
