 Make a folder where you want to have all the output files, and copy `pipeline.py` from `foam/pipeline/` to it. This script can be used to run all the parts of the pipeline, but can also be modified to rerun later steps with different settings on the condition that the earlier steps have been run at least once to generate the required intermediate data products.

 Add a file with the observations in a .tsv format. Its columns are the observables and their errors (suffix '\_err' for the error corresponding to a column). Frequencies, periods, and their errors are required for the full functionality of the pipeline. Teff, logg, logL, and their errors can be added to provide additional constraints on the asteroseismic solutions. Note that effective temperature should be added as Teff, but will be processed as logTeff (since L and g are normally used in log scale as well).
 Frequencies are preferred to be listed decreasing in value, so increasing in period. The code can handle the other way around if the theoretical grid is also extracted in that way. (If the frequencies are ordered decreasing in value, the highest frequency parts in an interrupted pattern will be matched first, which is preferred since those have a lower relative uncertainty). Missing frequencies in the observed pattern can be indicated by 'f_missing' as index and 0 values for the frequency, period, and their errors. This will cause the code to model it as an interrupted period spacing pattern.
